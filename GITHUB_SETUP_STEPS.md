# 🚀 Complete GitHub Setup for International Distribution

Your Pet Care Assistant is now ready for worldwide distribution! Follow these steps:

## 📋 **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and log in
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button or + icon)
3. **Repository name**: `pet-care-assistant`
4. **Description**: `🐾 AI-powered pet health companion - Download APK for Android`
5. **Public repository** (so friends can access)
6. **Don't initialize** (you already have files)
7. **Click "Create repository"**

## 🔗 **Step 2: Connect Your Local Code**

Copy and run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/caroline/Applications/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/work/start_up/AI_application/Pet_google"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pet-care-assistant.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔑 **Step 3: Set Up GitHub Secrets**

For automatic APK building, you need to add your Expo credentials:

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Click "Secrets and variables"** → **"Actions"**
4. **Click "New repository secret"** and add:

### Required Secret:
- **Name**: `EXPO_TOKEN`
- **Value**: Get from https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-username]/settings/access-tokens
  - Click "Create token"
  - Copy the token value
  - Paste in GitHub secret

## ✨ **Step 4: Create Your First Release**

Once code is pushed and secrets are set:

```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will trigger:
- ✅ **Automatic APK build**
- ✅ **GitHub release creation**  
- ✅ **Download link generation**

## 🌍 **Step 5: Share with Friends Worldwide**

After the build completes (10-15 minutes), you can share:

### **Download Link Format:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pet-care-assistant/releases/latest
```

### **What Friends See:**
- ✅ Professional download page

- **Latest Release**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pet-care-assistant/releases/latest`
- **All Releases**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pet-care-assistant/releases`
