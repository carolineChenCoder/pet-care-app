# Quick Testing Solution - Expo Go

Since the EAS build is having Gradle issues, here's a fast way to test your app immediately:

## ðŸš€ Option 1: Test with Expo Go (Immediate - 5 minutes)

### On Your Computer:
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/Users/caroline/Applications/Dropbox/Mac/Documents/work/start_up/AI_application/Pet_google"

# Start development server
npm start
# or: npx expo start
```

### On Your Android Phone:
1. **Install Expo Go** from Google Play Store
2. **Open Expo Go** app
3. **Scan QR code** that appears in terminal
4. **Your app loads instantly** on your phone!

## ðŸ”§ Option 2: Fix EAS Build Issues

The Gradle build failed because of mixed React Native CLI + Expo setup. Here's the fix:

### Step 1: Clean Setup
```bash
# Remove conflicting files (already done)
# android/ and ios/ folders moved to backup

# Install clean Expo dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 2: Generate Keystore
```bash
# Generate Android keystore manually
eas credentials:configure --platform android
# Follow prompts to generate keystore
```

### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
# After keystore is generated:
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
